# Java Multithreading

## Overview
I've created this project to grow as a comprehensive collection of Java code examples that demonstrate various concepts of multithreading and concurrency. It is designed to provide a practical understanding of how to create, manage, and synchronize threads in Java, as well as how to use high-level concurrency utilities provided by the Java Concurrency API.

I'm planning to add examples that will cover a wide range of topics, from basic thread creation to advanced synchronization techniques and concurrency utilities. Each example is accompanied by detailed explanations and comments to help understand the underlying concepts and their practical applications.

Contributions are welcome! If you have any improvements or additional examples that you would like to add, feel free to create a pull request.

# Notes
Notes are divides into following sections:

- **Overview**: Provide a brief introduction to multithreading, its importance, and real-world applications.
- **Basic Concepts**: Explain the fundamental concepts of thread creation, lifecycle, and basic operations like starting, joining, and setting priorities.
- **Synchronization**: Discuss the importance of synchronization in multithreading, different mechanisms for achieving thread safety, and examples of synchronized blocks and methods.
- **Inter-Thread Communication**: Elaborate on how threads communicate with each other using wait/notify mechanisms and illustrate this with the classic producer-consumer problem.
- **Concurrency Utilities**: Introduce the high-level concurrency utilities provided by Java, their use cases, and example code snippets.
- **Advanced Topics**: Dive into more complex topics like thread-local variables, deadlock detection, and the fork/join framework, providing detailed explanations and examples.
- **Best Practices**: Summarize best practices for writing robust, efficient, and thread-safe code in a multithreaded environment.
