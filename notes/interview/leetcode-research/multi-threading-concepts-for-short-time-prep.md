Basic concepts:

Ways of Thread creation
Thread priories, Thread Groups, Daemon Thread
Yield, sleep and join (Preventing thread from executing)
Synchronization (Block, method, static synchronization)
InterThread communication(Wait, notify and notifyAll)
Locks (reentrant lock and read write lock) and Conditions(Await and release)
Semaphores( Acquire and release)
Atomic variables
Blocking Queue(ArrayBlockingQueue, LinkedBlockingQueue)
Delay Dueue
ThreadPools (Executor framework)
Thread Local
Future
Volatile variables
concurrent hashmap and hashtable and diff
cyclic barrier and countdown latch
Theoretical conceps:
Deadlock
Livelock
Race Condition
mutex and semaphore diff
Process and thread
