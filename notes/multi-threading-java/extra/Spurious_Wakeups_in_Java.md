# Spurious Wakeups in Java
## Introduction
Spurious wakeups are a phenomenon in multithreading where a thread that is waiting on an object's monitor (using the wait() method) is awakened without any explicit notification from another thread (via notify() or notifyAll()). This can occur due to various reasons, including internal JVM behavior or operating system signals.

## Understanding Spurious Wakeups
Spurious wakeups are unpredictable and can happen at any time, making it challenging to rely solely on the wait() method for precise thread coordination.

When a spurious wakeup occurs, the waiting thread resumes execution as if it had received a notification, even though no other thread has called notify() or notifyAll() for that object.

## Handling Spurious Wakeups
To handle spurious wakeups and ensure correct program behavior, it is essential to use wait() within a loop that checks the condition being waited upon:

```java
synchronized (object) {
    while (!condition) {
        object.wait();
    }
    // Proceed with actions after condition is met
}
```
The loop ensures that even if a spurious wakeup occurs, the thread will recheck the condition and, if it is not satisfied, go back to waiting.

This pattern prevents the thread from proceeding with actions that should only be performed when the condition is genuinely met.

## Example
Here's an example demonstrating how to handle spurious wakeups in a producer-consumer scenario:

```java
class SharedResource {
    private boolean isDataAvailable = false;

    public synchronized void produce() throws InterruptedException {
        isDataAvailable = true;
        notifyAll();
    }

    public synchronized void consume() throws InterruptedException {
        while (!isDataAvailable) {
            wait();  // Handle spurious wakeups with a loop
        }
        isDataAvailable = false;
        // Consume data
    }
}
```
